Notes live time 


Git clone -> 
ls => list 

cd -> change directory 

-:master branch

Do not commit anything to master branch -> own branch own name.

git config -> identify name 

git branch -> edit file -> checkout 

----------------------

Currently only local -> remote // Local

E.g Steps // ON screen 
open source / access -> clone creating an instance 

git branch artorias_example

git checkout artorias_example 

Current action is changing the file that is being checked out on the master branch.

git status -> explain what has been changed // -> status like game status of character 

git add artorias_example OR git add . -> . is all -> staging area // specificity -> eventually get merged into master branch SPECIFIC

git commit -m "xxx" -> -m "adding meaningful message".

git log -> literally a log of gits commits / commit id ------------------------------------------------------------ need double check look 

git push -> --set-upstream origin artorias_example -> as deafult know where to push -> up to remote config// no branch on github no upstream branch 

git origin --set-upstream origin master -> set remote upstream configure
