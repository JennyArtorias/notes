Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1; // i++


Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even
            
            
            
            myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.

myVar += 5; will add 5 to myVar.
            
            
            "your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
            
            
            
            
" or ' inside of your string?

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
